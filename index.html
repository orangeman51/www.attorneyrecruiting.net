            <p>A client firm or company either solicits our assistance with its attorney recruiting needs or we identify it as having open positions that it seeks to fill. We obtain as extensive a description of the position as possible, which enables us to target candidates whose credentials satisfy a client's particular needs. If we are not currently working with candidates who are appropriate for a particular position, we will use our various resources to actively search for and solicit attorneys who are suitable for and interested in the position. We will not paper a client's walls with resumes that do not meet the job requirements. A prospective employer can be confident that the resumes we provide will be those of attorneys who closely fit the job specifications.</p>

            <p>First, we identify attorney candidates throughout the country who are seeking legal employment. We do this through cold-calls, referrals and solicitations for our services. We have in-depth conversations with all new applicants in order to gain a precise understanding of the aspects of their practice areas, identify geographic regions in which they would like to work, and ascertain whether we are in a position to assist them in finding the types of positions they are seeking in the locations they desire.<br><br>When appropriate, we then request that the candidate submit a resume and law school transcript via email. Upon receipt of this information, we examine our database, which contains a comprehensive list of job openings, to identify positions that are suitable for the particular candidate. We discuss each opportunity with the candidate and obtain the applicant's consent to forward his or her resume to each firm and company. As additional appropriate positions arise, we will contact the attorney to describe the positions and acquire the candidate's consent to submit his or her resume.<br><br>We ask that the lawyers with whom we work keep a running list of the firms and corporations to which they, we and other recruiters submit their resumes. Because industry standards generally dictate that the individual or agency which first forwarded the resume to an organization represents that candidate with respect to that submission, it is important to avoid duplicate submissions, which may cause confusion. Additionally, firms and corporations frown upon multiple resume submissions in that it may demonstrate a lack of organization on the part of the applicant.<br><br>After an attorney's resume is submitted to a law firm or corporation, we diligently follow up to ensure that the resume was received by the proper contact and apprise him or her of the status of the pending application. We follow up with the law firms and corporations during all stages of the process until completion, and communicate all updates to the candidate. These updates include requests for interviews, whether a job is filled and whether there simply is no interest in pursuing an attorney's candidacy. If a client requests an interview, we will arrange the meeting at a mutually convenient time. Although not always possible, we attempt to ascertain the reasons behind a decision not to pursue a candidate so that this information can be used in preparation for future interviews.<br><br>We review interview skills with candidates and prepare them for what they should expect on each interview. After the interview, we prefer to obtain feedback from the candidate first so that, if the attorney would like, we can relay this information to our client's representative. At this point, the client will request a second round of interviews, extend an offer, or inform us that there is no interest in continuing to pursue the candidate. The initial interview with some firms is a screening interview, where the attorney will have a brief meeting with one or two attorneys from the firm to ascertain whether they are interested in continuing to pursue the candidate. If so, a full round of interviews will be scheduled, and the candidate generally will meet with four to six lawyers from the firm. Some firms, on the other hand, omit the screening interview, and begin with a full round of interviews. In most cases, the candidate will meet with each representative from the firm separately rather than simultaneously. It can take anywhere from a few hours to a week or so to obtain the client's feedback. In appropriate situations, we will assist a candidate in negotiating the final terms of his or her offer.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>Learning and utilizing effective interview techniques are essential for a successful job search. Unfortunately, the best person will not necessarily secure the position. The individual performing the best at the interview will.</p>
            <h3>PREPARATION</h3>
            <p>Most people are nervous about being interviewed because usually there is a lot at stake. It is therefore very important to make the best of the opportunity by being well prepared.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Learn about your potential employer. Carefully review the law firm or company's web site, particularly the practice area for which you are interviewing. Conduct a general search of the law firm or company on the Internet utilizing a search engine such as www.google.com. Conduct a more specific search of the firm on Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis and on the web sites of The National Law Journal and state law journals.</li>
              <li>Obtain the name and title of the interviewer(s). Familiarize yourself with the background, including practice area, and education of the interviewer. Ascertain the extent to which the interviewer influences the hiring process and decision.</li>
              <li>Try to anticipate some of the questions that the interviewer will ask you and prepare responses.</li>
              <li>Prepare questions that you want to ask the interviewer (see below).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>THE DAY OF THE INTERVIEW</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Dress in professional attire. There may be situations where "business casual" dress is appropriate, depending on the dress policy of the law firm or company. If you are unsure of the firm's dress code, err on the side of wearing professional attire.</li>
              <li>Arrive at the interview on time or a few minutes early. This demonstrates that you take the opportunity seriously. Allot extra time for traffic, getting lost and other unexpected occurrences. This will help to ensure that you arrive at the interview relaxed and composed.</li>
              <li>Bring with you to the interview extra copies of your resume, a list of references, if appropriate, copies of letters of recommendation, if available, and an analytical writing sample, such as a brief or memorandum of law.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>DURING THE INTERVIEW</h3>
            <p>The purpose of an interview between a candidate and a prospective employer is to exchange information and to ascertain whether they would be an appropriate match.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Start the interview with a pleasant smile, a friendly greeting, a solid handshake, a proper introduction and eye contact, which should be sustained throughout the interview. If there is more than one interviewer at a time, look at each of them equally.</li>
              <li>Be courteous to all employees of the firm.</li>
              <li>Allow the interviewer to guide the interview.</li>
              <li>Communication is the key to success. Many times how you say something is more important than what you say. Speak articulately, clearly, audibly and confidently. Do not be inhibited and clam up, argue with or criticize what the interviewer says. Do not come across as aggressive or superior. Make casual conversation when appropriate to keep the mood light. Listen attentively to the interviewer, respond effectively, enthusiastically and congenially, and look for opportunities to offer and collect feedback. Ask for clarification if you do not understand a question or concept presented to you.</li>
              <li>Maintain a positive attitude throughout the interview.</li>
              <li>Emphasize your strengths.</li>
              <li>Avoid giving negative responses, such as "I can't" or "I won't" or "I've never." Even if you have to say no to something or refuse something say it in a positive manner. "Although I have extensive litigation experience, I have not previously dealt with this particular type of litigation." Don't solely use negative phrases.</li>
              <li>Do not speak about your personal or financial problems.</li>
              <li>Do not speak unfavorably about previous and present employers.</li>
              <li>Body language is also very significant. Sit up straight and comfortably. In addition to evaluating your knowledge, background, experience and skills in a specific area of the law, the interviewer will assess your level of confidence, people skills, ability to be a team-player, your efficacy as an attorney, your degree of enthusiasm in the position, your level of motivation, and the likelihood that you would be a good personality fit with the other attorneys. Do not smoke, chew gum, touch or play with things in the interviewer's office, fidget or move around nervously, touch your face, tap your foot or exhibit similarly inappropriate behavior.</li>
              <li>Make sure the interview ends on a positive note by thanking the interviewer(s) for his or her time, shaking his or her hand, thanking the interviewer's assistant if you met him or her, making a note of the scheduling of any further conversations or interviews that the employer may request, noting additional items that may be requested, such as a writing sample if you did not provide one, and noting the time-frame in which someone from the company will get back to you or your recruiter to inform you of whether the firm is interested in moving forward with your candidacy. If it is, either an offer will be extended or you will be requested to return to the firm for additional interviews.</li>
              <li>Upon exiting the office, thank the receptionist.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>AFTER THE INTERVIEW</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Send thank you letters via regular mail or email. If possible, personalize the note by mentioning specific topics and issues discussed during the interview.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>QUESTIONS TO ASK THE EMPLOYER</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>What will be my duties and responsibilities?</li>
              <li>Where will I fit into the overall organizational structure of the firm and the practice group?</li>
              <li>To whom will I report? Where does he or she fit in the structure of the firm and the department? In what type of cases is he or she involved?</li>
              <li>Who will report to me? How experienced are they?</li>
              <li>How is an attorney evaluated?</li>
              <li>Who are some of your representative clients?</li>
              <li>Where are the firm's plans for expansion and growth?</li>
              <li>What are the opportunities for growth and advancement in this position? What is the partnership track?</li>
              <li>Will traveling be required?</li>
              <li>What mentoring and training do you provide?</li>
              <li>How has this company fared during the most recent recession?</li>
              <li>What makes your firm different from its competitors?</li>
              <li>What are the company's strengths and weaknesses?</li>
              <li>How would you describe your company's personality and management style?</li>
              <li>Describe the work environment.</li>
              <li>What qualities are you looking for in your new hires?</li>
